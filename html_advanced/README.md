In this and coming projects, we will implement from scratch a webpage from a designer file.

For this first project, we will focus on the HTML structure only - no CSS, no style - just pure HTML semantic.

The designer file will be available on Figma(link: https://www.figma.com/files/recent?fuid=1222559222280735954).
